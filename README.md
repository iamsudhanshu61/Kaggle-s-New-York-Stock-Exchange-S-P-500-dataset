# Kaggle-s-New-York-Stock-Exchange-S-P-500-dataset
In this project we will analyze real life data from the New York Stock Exchange. We will be drawing a subset of a large dataset provided by Kaggle that contains historical financial data from S&P 500 companies. We have created a smaller subset of the data that you will be using for the project.
